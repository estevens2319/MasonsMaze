The goal of the game is to navigate the maze and collect numbers and operators to construct an equation that equals the number that unlocks the center chest.
There are 3 types of enemies throughout the maze, one that chases the player when it is within range, one that will hunt the player from anywhere in the maze, and one that is given set patrol points.
Various power ups and traps are scattered throuhghout the maze to either help or hinder the player or the enemies. 

The maze is randomly generated at each new game, and is guaranteed that from any point in the maze you can reach the center chest. 

Before starting the game, make sure MainMenu scene is loaded and SampleScene scene is either not loaded or unloaded. Maximize the gameplay screen.
If something is broken, make sure both the main menu scene and the SampleScene are in the build path in File>>Build Settings.
